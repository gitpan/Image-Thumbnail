Image/Thumbnail version 0.41
============================

This module uses the ImageMagick or GD libraries to easily make
thumbnail images from files or objects from the specified library.

I made "Image::GD::Thumbnail" a while ago for myself, put on CPAN
because I need to get to it elsewhere and it's cheap FTP. A few people
asked for a ImageMagick version, so I made that, and then put them
together in this.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
