NAME
    Image::Magick - produces thumbnail images with GD or ImageMagick

SYNOPSIS
            use Image::Thumbnail;

                    size       => 55,
                    create     => 1,
                    inputpath  => 'test.jpg',
                    outputpath => 'test_t.jpg',

            # Create a thumbnail from 'test.jpg' as 'test_t.jpg'
            # using GD.
            my $t = new Image::Thumbnail(
                    module     => 'GD',
                    size       => 55,
                    create     => 1,
                    inputpath  => 'test.jpg',
                    outputpath => 'test_t.jpg',
        );

            # Create a thumbnail as 'test_t.jpg' from an ImageMagick object
            # using ImageMagick, or GD.
            my $t = new Image::Thumbnail(
                    size       => 55,
                    create     => 1,
                    object     => $my_image_magick_object,
                    outputpath => 'test_t.jpg',
        );

            # Create four more of ever-larger sizes
            for (1..4){
                    $t->{size} = 55+(10*$_);
                    $t->create;
            }

            __END__

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the ImageMagick or GD libraries to easily make
    thumbnail images from files or objects from the specified library.

    I made "Image::GD::Thumbnail" a while ago for myself, put on CPAN
    because I need to get to it elsewhere and it's cheap FTP. A few people
    asked for a ImageMagick version, so I made that, and then put them
    together in this.

PREREQUISITES
    "Image::Magick" or "GD".

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CONSTRUCTOR new
    Parameters are supplied as a hash or hash-like structure of pairs: See
    the the SYNOPSIS entry elsewhere in this document.

  REQUIRED PARAMETERS

    size
        The size you with the longest side of the thumbnail to be.

  PARAMETERS TO CHOOSE FROM

    You must supply one of either:

    object
        An object-reference created by your chosen package. Naturally you
        can't supply this field if you haven't specified a "module" field
        (see above).

    inputpath
        Path to an image to use as the source file.

  OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

    module ( GD | ImageMagick )
        If you wish to use a specific module, place its name here. You must
        have the module you require already installed!

        Supplying no name will allow ImageMagick to be tried before GD.

    create
        Put any value in this field if you wish the constructor to call the
        "create" method automatically before returning.

    inputtype, outputtype
        If you are using "GD", you can explicitly set the input and output
        formats for the image file, provided you use a string that can be
        evaluated to a "GD"-supported image format (see the GD manpage).

        Default behaviour is to attempt to ascertin the file type and to
        create the thumbnail in the same format. If the type cannot be
        defined (you are using "GD", have supplied the "object" field and
        not the "outputtype" field) then the output file format defaults to
        "jpeg".

    CHAT
        Put any value in this field for real-time process info.

  ERRORS

    Any errors will be printed to "STDOUT". If they completely prevent
    processing, they will be fatal ("croak"ed). If partial processing has
    taken place by the explicit or implicit calling of the "create" method,
    then the field of the same name will have value.

    Depending on how far processing has proceded, other fields may have
    useful values: the "module" field will contain the name of the module
    used; the "object" field may contain an object of the module used; the
    "thumb" field may contain a thumbnail image.

METHOD create
    Creates a thumbnail using the supplied object. Called automatically if
    you construct with the "create" field flagged.

  EXPORT

    None by default.
