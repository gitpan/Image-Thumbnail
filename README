DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the ImageMagick library to create a thumbnail image
    with no side bigger than you specify.

    There is no OO API, since that would seem to be over-kill. The
    subroutine "create" takes two arguments: the first is an ImageMagick
    image object, the second is either the size in pixels you wish the
    longest side of the image to be, or an "Image::Magick"-style 'geometry'
    (eg "100x120") which the thumbnail must fit.

    It returns an ImaegMagick image object (the thumbnail), as well as the
    number of pixels of the *width* and *height* of the image, as integer
    scalars.
